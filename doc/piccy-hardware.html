<h2>Hardware support information</h2>
<p>Information about the hardware support provided by the kernels in various
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases">Debian releases</a>
is made available by the <code>Piccy</code> plugin.</p>

<p> <code>Piccy</code> indexes the kernel config and PCI-Id mappings for the
i686 kernels in all debian releases including the
<a href="http://backports.debian.org/">backports.debian.org</a> repositories.
Additionally, the kernel from the kernel team's build server repository may be
indexed if it is available.
Kernel updates released by the security team are included in this indexing
although these rarely (if ever?) change the data.</p>

<!--
<p>Mappings between PCI-Ids and xorg modules are attempted and links to the Debian wiki are provided for further information about kernel modules.
-->

<p>The PCI-Id for a device may be obtained with the command
<code>lspci -nn</code> (from the
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/pciutils">pciutils</a> package).
Further information and other approaches to finding this information
can be found on the
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/HowToIdentifyADevice/PCI">Debian wiki</a>.
An example output from <code>lspci -nn</code> is:</p>

<div class="example">
0b:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG [Golan] Network Connection [8086:4222] (rev 02)
</div>
<p>which shows that this wireless device has a PCI-Id of <code>8086:4222</code>.

<h3>PCI-Id to kernel module</h3>
<p>Display the kernel module or modules that claim to support a
specified PCI-Id.
The device and its manufacturer are identified based on the
<a href="http://pciids.sourceforge.net/">pci.ids database</a>.
An index of kernel modules is used to see which, if any, modules
will claim that device (based on <code>modules.pcimap</code>).
A link to <a href="http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/">kmuto's HCL</a> is provided
for further information about the device.
Links to appropriate pages in the
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/">Debian wiki</a>
are also given.
</p>

<div class="example">
    <div class="synopsis input">pciid <span class="var">pci-id</span>
                [ --release  <span class="var">release</span> ]
    </div>

    <div class="input">pciid 8086:4222</div>
    <div class="output">[8086:4222] is 'PRO/Wireless 3945ABG [Golan] Network Connection' from 'Intel Corporation' with kernel modules 'ata_generic', 'iwl3945' in squeeze. See also http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/index.rhtmlx?check=1&amp;lspci=8086:4222 http://wiki.debian.org/iwlegacy</div>

    <div class="input">pciid 8086:4237 --release lenny</div>
    <div class="output">[8086:4237] is 'PRO/Wireless 5100 AGN [Shiloh] Network Connection' from 'Intel Corporation' with no known kernel module in lenny but has kernel module 'iwlwifi', 'ata_generic', 'snd-hda-intel' in sid. See also http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/index.rhtmlx?check=1&amp;lspci=8086:4237</div>
</div>

<p>Note that a few modules like <code>ata_generic</code>, <code>nvidiafb</code>
and <code>snd-hda-intel</code> are almost always
false-positives from a wildcard match from the driver - unless you were actually
asking about a disk or audio card. (Hints on how to do
this matching more robustly are most welcome.)</p>

<p><code>Piccy</code> will search through the sid kernel if no matches in the
kernel for the requested release are found.</p>

<h3>Device name to PCI-Id</h3>
<p>Users frequently know the name of the device but not the actual PCI-Id.
Trying to work out the PCI-Id from the name isn't easy, but can sometimes be
done. This is usually best done in a private message to save flooding the
channel.</p>

<div class="example">
    <div class="synopsis input">pciname <span class="var">keyword</span>
    </div>
</div>
<p>The <span class="var">keyword</span> is part of the device name from
the pci.ids database. It cannot contain non-alphanumeric characters
and has a wildcard added to the beginning and end of the term.</p>

<p>For example, a user claimed to have a <code>82573E</code> network
adapter but stated that the PCI-Id was `80086:1082`
(which is malformed and incorrect).</p>

<div class="example">
    <div class="input">pciname 82573E</div>
    <div class="output">'82573E' matched: [8086:108c] '82573E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (Copper)' from 'Intel Corporation', [8086:108e] '82573E KCS (Active Management)' from 'Intel Corporation', [8086:10b3] '82573E PRO/1000 PM Network Connection' from 'Intel Corporation'</div>
</div>

<h3>PCI-Id to Xorg driver</h3>
Working out which Xorg driver should be used for a piece of hardware isn't always as easy as it sounds. Piccy attempts to match the PCI-Id of the hardware to the Xorg PCI-Id database.

Note that this database is currently only available for `lenny`.

{{{
xorg ''pci-id'' [ `- -release` ''release'' ]
}}}

where the options have the same meaning [[#PiccyOptions|as above]].

Examples:
{{{
xorg 1002:7145
<judd> In lenny, device 1002:7145 is matched by xorg drivers: 'radeon', 'radeonhd'.
}}}

{{{
xorg 1106:1122
<judd> Device 1106:1122 is not matched by any xorg drivers in lenny. In sid, it is matched by xorg driver: 'openchrome'.
}}}
