"Piccy" -- a PCI-Id plugin for supybot
======================================

Copyright (c) 2009, Stuart Prescott
Piccy is released under a BSD-style licence (below).


Quick start guide
=================

Piccy needs data files to run -- the "refreshdata" utility can download the
necessary files from sourceforge and from a Debian mirror.

After unpacking the Piccy files in the appropriate place for your supybot to
find them, create a directory for Piccy to store its data files. The data files
for 6 Debian kernels amounts to ~3 MB. The most sensible place for this data
is probably in the supybot data directory:

  /path/to/your/supybot/data/piccy/

So:
  mkdir /path/to/your/supybot/data/piccy
  cd /path/to/your/supybot/plugins/Piccy
  ./refreshdata /path/to/your/supybot/data/piccy

and wait while the kernel packages are downloaded.


Further details
===============

Piccy needs:

* a mapping of PCI-Ids to device manufacturer and device name
* a mapping of PCI-Ids to kernel module
* the kernel config file

Piccy comes with a script "refreshdata" to grab the latest copies of these
files from the internet.

The PCI-Ids file is the same as the pci.ids file that is shipped in the debian
package pciutils and which can be updated using the command "update-pciids".
You can configure Piccy to directly use /usr/share/misc/pci.ids or you can
have a local copy of this file that is routinely updated using "refreshdata".

In the Debian kernel packages, module mapping is done at install time using
depmod. Piccy uses the /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.pcimap file and you
can either copy that into the configured data directory for Piccy or you can
let "refreshdata" download the kernel module, unpack it into a temporary
location and run depmod over it. Doing so requires that you are on a Debian
system as "refreshdata" makes use of apt-cache and aptitude to obtain the
necessary information about the packages that are available and the to 
download the .deb files. At present, "refreshdata" will only look for kernels
for the current architecture that apt would use (see dpkg-architecture) but
the default package matching regular expression assumes that -686 kernels will
be available.

The kernel config files are shipped by Debian kernel packages as 
/boot/config-$(uname -r) and are extracted by the "refreshdata" utility at
the same time as the pcimap is obtained. You can always give Piccy some other
kernel config file if you want.

The "refreshdata" utility can be configured by editing the kernel.list file.
The releases that are to be refreshed, the mirror to use and the regular
expresison that should be used to identify the most recent kernel are all
configurable in this file. The format of this file is described within it.

At present, the available releases for Piccy to answer queries for are
configured within the source code.


Example usage
=============

  pciid 8086:4222
  pciid "[8086:4222]"                # note the quotes!
  pciid 8086:4222 --release sid

  kconfig SMB_FS
  kconfig SMB_FS --release etch
