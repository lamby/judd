Documentation for the Judd and Piccy plugins
============================================

The documentation is split into a number of separate files just to make
editing the documents simpler. The documentation is presented to the user
as one large file.

Conventions:

* Technical terms from policy and commands and options are rendered in
  <code> … </code> tags

* Links to user documentation for explaining terms are most welcome -- links
  to wiki.debian.org or the apt reference guide are good. Links to the
  Debian Policy Manual are appropriate too, but user-focussed documentation
  is better.

* A synopsis of each command showing the possible options and syntax should
  be presented first. The usual conventions of man-pages are used:
    - Mandatory arguments and subcommands are written in plain text
    - Optional arguments are indicated with square brackets: [ --foo ]
    - Place-holders in the synopsis are italicised: <span class="var"> … </span>
    - The "synopsis input" classes are used for the example command.

* Useful examples that demonstrate common uses of the commands are welcome.
  Examples that show the difference that a particular option makes are good.
    - The "input" class is used to mark the command line.
    - The "output" class marks the bot response.
    - Feel free to join multiple lines from long output from the bot.

* Documentation is XHTML 1.0 Transitional, uses UTF-8 encoding and both XHTML
  and CSS should validate.
