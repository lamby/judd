Supybot control scripts
=======================

The init scripts for the supybot are composed of three files:

  supybot-init
      an LSB-compliant init script for supybot designed to be installed as
      /etc/init.d/supybot and be included in the machine's startup scripts to
      start the supybot on boot.

      The init script understands the "start" "stop" and "restart" commands.

  supybot-default
      a settings file for the above init script that is sourced by it to set
      parameters such as the location of bot and the name for the config file.
      The file is intended to be installed as /etc/default/supybot.

  supybotctl
      a control script (think apache2ctl) that runs /etc/init.d/supybot to
      start ans top the bot. The script uses sudo to change user to the bot's
      dedicated user; it's solely designed to ease the burden of running the
      bot through the init script but without having to have root privileges
      in order to change uid later.

Notes
=====

Supybot likes to own all its own files. It's not feasible to have the config
file owned by another user as supybot will try to chmod it during startup (and
will crash when that fails).

The init script tells supybot to daemonise and thus requires supybot to write
its own PID file. To do that, the supybot.pidFile config key must be set to the
appropriate location. (A sensible place is logs/botname.pid).

A user for the supybot needs to be created and sudo needs to be configured
to allow bot-wranglers to be able to use supybotctl to start/stop the bot.


Installation summary
====================

Install the scripts:

      cd /path/to/supybot/init-scripts
      ln -s $PWD/supybot-init /etc/init.d/supybot
      cp $PWD/supybot-default /etc/default/supybot
      ln -s $PWD/supybotctl /usr/local/bin/

Add the startup script to the runlevels

      update-rc.d supybot defaults 30

Set BOTUSER and CONFFILE in /etc/default/supybot

Make sure supybot is going to write the PID file.

      cd $BOTDIR
      sed -i "s,supybot.pidFile:,supybot.pidFile: $PWD/logs/$BOTNAME.pid," $CONFFILE

Create a dedicated user for the bot and set file ownerships/permissions

      adduser $BOTUSER
      addgroup each_bot_admin $BOTUSER

      chown -R $BOTUSER: .
      chmod g+w -R .

Configure sudo to permit the bot wranglers to manage the bot.

      [use visudo to add the following]

          User_Alias      BOTOWNERS =  you, me, theotherone
          BOTOWNERS ALL = ($BOTUSER) NOPASSWD : /etc/init.d/supybot

Start the bot up and check that it's working.

        invoke-rc.d supybot start
        tail -f logs/messages.log
